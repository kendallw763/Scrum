# Scrum

I interpret user needs through analyizing the market, and finding a relationship of the product with the user. THis will seamlessly enhance the life of teh user. Creating user stories can help with this because it gives a bird's eye view of the project as a whole. Projects are built around what the user needs in the application or product to make theier lives just a little better in the long run. The approach of developing programs should start by simply following the software Devlopment Lifecycle. Initially, I would gather requirements and anaylize what the customer/user needs within thenproudcut. A proccess in agile I hope to incorperate into my future development is working software over comprehensive documentation, coupled with pursuing technical excellence. This will ensure the prodcut is up and running. As opposed to having the requirements and documentation the applciation needs but without truthfully building the software to functional properly. Finally, what being a good team member means in software development to me is to listen, ask questions I am unsure of, always take initiative, and help others when they need it.
